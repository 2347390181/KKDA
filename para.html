<p>The horrific incident of the rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata has sent shock waves across the nation and again has drawn our attention towards the issue of women safety in India. This incident is drawing the same public ire which was generated by the Nirbhaya Rape case.

Despite advancements in technology and urbanization, women in India continue to face violence and discrimination. It is deeply distressing that nearly 88 rape cases are reported daily in the country, with many more likely going unreported. Our rich cultural heritage and value system have failed to protect the very individuals who are the foundation of society.
